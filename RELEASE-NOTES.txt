OINK Interoperability Toolkit 0.3
=================================

* A new HL7v2 Adapter that takes A01,A05,A28,A31 HL7v2.4 messages and maps them to Patient POSTs. The Adapter also supports Patient Query searchs in the 'other direction'.
* Extensive improvements to the Integration Tests which test inter-adapter behaviour when deployed on OSGi containers, including lifecycle management of RabbitMQ Test instances.
* Integration Tests now optionally reliant on externalized adapter property files if the default 'develop' ones aren't usable.
* First version to be tested against real OpenEyes REST Api
