OINK Interoperability Toolkit 0.3
=================================

New System Requirements
-----------------------

Host needs Vagrant (vagrantup.com) installed to perform integration tests.

Whats New
----------

* A new HL7v2 Adapter that takes A01,A05,A28,A31 HL7v2.4 messages and maps them to Patient POSTs. The Adapter also supports Patient Query searchs in the 'other direction'.
* A new Karaf command, oink:status which reports if an adapter has started or not.
* Extensive improvements to the Integration Tests which test inter-adapter behaviour when deployed on OSGi containers, including the use of multiple VMs.
* Integration Tests now utilising Vagrant to simulate running oink adapters on separate machines.
* First version to be tested against real OpenEyes REST Api


Known Issues
------------

* Not tested against real external HL7v2 Server
* OINK Kar does not contain Camel dependencies.
* OINK Custom Distribution cannot install oink adapters when offline and no maven local repository is present.
* Vagrant VMs are slow to initialise. Runtime on OpenEyes CI Server is ~30mins for integration testsing.
* Spurious Karaf log warning messages from Swissbox during feature installation. Will be fixed in later versions of Karaf
